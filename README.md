# Car-Sales

### Project Overview

This project focuses on car sales from 1980s to 2010s with many different variables affecting sales such as car make and model, manufacturing year, odometer reading, and condition. We aim to determine which factors affect selling prices and find which yields the most profit. Using SQL, this project will answer key business questions around vehicle information, attributes, and seller performance. 

### About the Data

The primary dataset can be found on <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/syedanwarafridi/vehicle-sales-data/data/>. 

### Tools Used

- Excel - Data Cleaning
- SQL - EDA

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

1. Data loading
2. Data Cleaning and Sorting
3. Data Formatting and Transforming

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was performed to answer key questions, such as, but not limited to:

1. How do selling prices vary by make, model, and body type?

2. Do vehicles typically sell above or below market value (MMR)?

3. What is the average price difference between automatic and manual vehicles?

4. How do vehicle age, mileage, and condition impact selling price?

5. Which states and sellers generate the highest revenue?

6. Are there seasonal trends in used car sales and pricing?

### Results/Findings

1. We found that customers with "Fair" credit scores tend to exit the bank the most compared to other credit scores. This is also true for both genders.
2. Customers with only 1 product from the bank tend to exit the most compared to multiple product users. Another note, we found that users with 4 products have all exited the bank.
3. "Old" customers whose over the age of 55 had the highest percentage in exiting the bank. 36.75% of "old" users have churned, which is a little more than 1/3 of users.
4. We found users that had been with the bank for years 1 through 5 were most likely to churn compared to newly acquired users and users who had stayed past 5 years.


### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:

We recommend trying to retain the customers as soon as they are acquired. The rate of churning appears to happen after year 1, so any time before that is crucial. We may also recommend to target customers with higher than "Fair" credit scores as the higher the credit score, the less likely the customers are to churn. Afterwards, we may suggest to promote other business products to the customers to have them stay with the business as most customers tend to churn with only 1 product.

### Limitations

This provided dataset was limited to a certain extent. More context and information may be needed to fully depict the accuracy of customer churn. Maybe conduct a survey for these individual customers to gauge their satisfaction levels with the business. This may help determine if the customer is likely to churn or not.
